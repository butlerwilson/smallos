Ok, this is a small os project. Most based on the <orange's one os implement>. Here we will learn how to implement
a small or a simple os. Although it is small and simple, our os will has basic management of operating system.
Actually, the project is difficult, you need most common knowledges about computer. Implement the operating system,
we should know what is operating system. The wikipedia is said that "An operating system (OS) is a collection of
software that manages computer hardware resources and provides common services for computer programs. The operating
system is an essential component of the system software in a computer system. Application programs usually require
an operating system to function.". We got it that os is software that manages hardwares and provides basic services
so that applications can runs in operating system. At first time, maybe you don't think that you can implement a
small os. But the windows, unix and linux are all implement by  human. So you should always confident. But here also
has some problems you will meet. Don't scare. Just do it! If can't implement any more, have a rest. All you did is
because your interesting, so keep your interest forever.
